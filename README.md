# FEDCULA - Fraudulent Email Detection using CNN and URL Lexical Analysis

### This repository is the Final Year Project for B.Tech Computer Engineering, MPSTME, NMIMS  University

### Abstract

Emails have become an integral part of our lives, be it personal or professional, emails are used everywhere. It is one of the most popular mode of communication. Everyday millions of the spam mails are sent over internet to targeted population to advertise services, products and dangerous software etc. Most websites require the customers to enter their email ID, increasing the risk of exposure to spammers who attack them by sending spam messages. There are many techniques that can be used to detect fraudulent emails. The aim of this project is to create a model that works in real time using machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect fraudulent emails and displaying them to the user. This model will first fetch the emails from the user's inbox and pass the emails to the classifier. After pre-processing the emails, machine learning and deep learning techniques are applied to the emails to classify it into fraudulent and non-fraudulent emails.
